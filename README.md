I go by Amy or Cake, but if you don't know me that well it'd be appreciated if you used Amy as a way to refer to me!

I almost NEVER interact with anyone first, so if I do end up interacting first (crowning your skin or saying you look like a cool person), it's a subtle way of me wanting to be friends with you but geniunely just being too shy to say it ..

I struggle with communication a lot, especially if i'm talking to someone new, so I apologize for that if it seems like i'm being dry or don't wanna talk to you.. :( I really do !!

My mind also randomly blanks out a lot of the time, so it's easy for me to lose my train of thought .. it'd be appreciated if you be patient with me at those times !

If you see me sitting by myself, don't be afraid to hide behind or cover me! I'm always here to provide C+H if wanted, unless i'm with a friend, which i'd prefer you ask in whisper before you do ! ★

PLEASE do not copy my skins, howeer you can take inspiration, but please ask before you do! I won't force you to give credits but i'd love it if you did !!

If I EVER have a skin that looks similar to yours, PLEASE LET ME KNOW SO I CAN FIX THE ISSUE , I don't like accidentally upsetting people :C

I do age regress, but if fully acting like a child, i'm most likely gonna be in a **Tails** or **Cream** pony !

# Tags that I MAY use in my name and their meaning! :3

**W2I** - Whisper to Interact ⟢ Interaction is fine, but i'd prefer it to be in whispers instead of public chats! This doesn't apply to friends !

**INT** (rarely used) - Interact! ⟢ Interaction is fine in public chat OR whisper! 

**DNIUF** - Do Not Interact Unless Friend ⟢ I'd prefer interaction from friends only, since I must not be in a good mood to talk to other people ..

**DNIUCF** - Do Not Interact Unless Close Friend ⟢ I'm either in a REALLY bad mood or just close to breaking down..

**DNIUP** - Do Not Interact Unless Party ⟢ I only wanna talk to the people in party ! ( Basically just DNIUCF except i'm *probably* not close to breaking down..)

**DNI** - Do Not Interact! ⟢ NOBODY can interact, unless i'm already sitting with you or talk to you first.

**NV** - Non Verbal ⟢ Not in a mood to talk or don't wanna use my words. Usually followed up with one of the DNI's, if not though, pay attention to facial expressions or actions for a response / a hint at what I wanna do ! 

**SV** - Semi Verbal! ⟢ Small responses.. basically my default, I never feel the need to put in my name but theres times where I do! :P
